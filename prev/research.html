        <h2>PEPR Hohlraum</h2>
        <img src="images/paper.jpg" style="float: left" />
        <p>
          High uniformity hohlraum designs are essential for achieving high yield in 
          indirect-drive inertial confinement fusion experiments. However, only recently
          has there been motivation toward spherical-based hohlraums.
        </p>
        <p>
          The PEPR hohlraum is a novel geometry for the OMEGA 60-beam
          laser. This hohlraum would provide excellent implosion uniformity and promise insight
          towards spherical hohlraum performance.

        <h2>Phase Transitions of Fiber Networks</h2>
        <p>
          Fiber networks are prevalent throughout nature, from cartilage to zebrafish embryos.
          These biological tissues demonstrate unique mechanical properties, such as
          its reponses to stress. For example, top layer of cartilage is up
          to 10-100 times more compliant than the deeper layers.
        </p>
        <p>
          I wrote simulations to model the mechanical responses of these fiber networks. 
          After applying a strain onto the network, highly-optimized 
          (GPU-accelerated, sparsified, vectorized, pre-conditioned) numerical methods
	  find minimal energy state of the networks. The code is written in a modular-fashion and generalized
          enough in that it can be applied to both 2-D and 3-D lattices.
        </p>

          *The animation shown only uses around \(10^3\) nodes, though the code can
          easily handle beyond \(10^7\) nodes on a single GPU.

        <h2>Accelerating Wasserstein Gradient Flow</h2>
        <img src="images/wasserstein_comp.gif" style="float: left" />
        <p>
        As part of my Functional Analysis final project, I extended previous works 
        looking at gradient flow under the Wasserstein-2 metric. I consider a new 
        gradient flow update which imitates a descent method typically used for 
        structural relaxation. 
        </p>
        <p>
          I define new modifications to Hamiltonian dynamics to incorporate both damping and "steering" 
          for the momentum updates.
          The following GIFs show the accelerated method with KL divergence as the energy functional.

        <h2>ICF Target Chamber Designs</h2>
        <img src="images/proposed_design.png" style="float: right" />
        <p>
        An ignition-scale laser system capable of comparing both direct-drive and indirect-drive 
        with high uniformity (on the same target chamber) does not yet exist. We propose a port
        configuration that supports symmetric direct-drive implosions with minimal adjustments of the beam pointings
        </p>
        <p>
          I developed a 3D viewfactor code to simulate capsule uniformity during
          indirect-drive implosions. The program was written in FORTRAN (and
          using OpenMP for multiprocessing). I used the code to compare hohlraum
          geometries as well as test the possibilities of new target chamber
          designs.

        <h2>Panoptic Segmentation of Cartilage</h2>
        <p>
        	Quantifying and drawing outlines of cells in fluorescence
		microscopy images is especially important to studying cellular
		responses and to biological sciences as a collective. However,
		the process of manually segmenting cells is tedious and challenging,
		 especially when tracking videos of cells. A video of
		small sample of impacted articular cartilage can have as many
		as 5000 cells across 1000+ time points.
	</p>
		An implementation of Mask R-CNN was trained on images/frames of impacted
		cartilage. The initial weights were pre-trained on the COCO dataset to
		support transfer learning, so only the head layers were trained.
		Due to the noisiness of the dataset and limited training time, the 
		model was not robust enough to perform segmentation to a high certainty.
		However, the results suggest that much of noise and inaccuracies within 
		the pre-labeled dataset were not as present within the model.

        <h2>Clinical Cardiovascular Research Center</h2>
        <p>
          During high school, I developed several softwares at CCRC of
          University of Rochester. The first being QTClock (shown on the right).
        </p>
        <p>
          QTClock obtained data from ECG recordings and plotted both the QT
          interval along with a color gradient corresponding to the patientâ€™s
          intake drug concentration in a clock-like graph. I also developed an
          online calculator that assesses the absolute risk of life-threatening
          cardiac events in patients with long QT syndrome.
