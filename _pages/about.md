<article>

<p>Hi! I'm a first-year PhD student at Stanford, advised by <a href="https://graphics.stanford.edu/~kayvonf/">Kayvon Fatahalian</a>. My interests include physically based simulations and high performance computing. I was undergraduate at Cornell, advised by <a href="https://physics.cornell.edu/itai-cohen">Itai Cohen</a> and <a href="https://physics.cornell.edu/james-sethna">Jim Sethna</a>.  Before that, I also worked with <a href="https://www.lle.rochester.edu/education/research-areas/integrated-modeling-group/integrated-modeling-group-3/r-stephen-craxton-bio/">R. Stephen Craxton</a>. </p>
